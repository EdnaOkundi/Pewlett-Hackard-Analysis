# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
In this deliverable, Bobby was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, 
and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

Results:
At the moment at Pewlett Hackard,64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, 
which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount 
of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise 
that will be leaving the company in the years to come. 

An ERD was created used to create  the six relevant tables. The seventh table (retirement_titles) 
was created but I was unable to export into a CSV file, hence saving directly. Unique Tables was equally created and imported
A list of candidates that can qualify to become members of the mentorship program was created too;
they can be referenced as "senior" employees amongst the general staff.The mentorship_eligibility table was also created by joining the employees, department employees, and titles tables. 
In this case, the criterion for the join was that the employees were born in 1965 and that they were currently working at PH, 
in order for them to apply to the retiring/mentorship package. There were 1,549 employees eligible
